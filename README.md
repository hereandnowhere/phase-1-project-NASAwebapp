# phase-1-project-NASAwebapp
This is my phase 1 project demonstrating what I've learned in the first phase and putting it all together. I will be using NASA's free AstroPhoto of the day API to build a dynamic rendering of this popular API, that will have some click and hover events, a like button, a share to instagram button, as well as a slick, modern css design.
