# phase-1-project-NASAwebapp
This is my phase 1 project demonstrating what I've learned in the first phase and putting it all together. I will be using NASA's free AstroPhoto of the day API to build a dynamic rendering of this popular API, that will have a click event to reveal the discription of the photo or hide it accordingly, and hover over event that will zoom the picture in a little, as well as a slick css design.


# Goals for the project

To demonstrate that I can use javascript to dynamicly manipulate and add to the html, as well as the css design of the web page. To demonstrate that I can use Javascript to access an API and use its data to build out the content of the website. To demonstrate my understtanding of implementing events to create a dynamic user experience of the webpage.

# Project Overview



# First steps

Building the skeleton of the HTML. Setting up the HTML page so that it has the heading, body, and appropriate divs to be changed and to place the API in with javascript. Setting placeholder text and  Adding the css page link and javascript page link to begin building it out.

# Second Step

Next we are going to use Javascript to fetch the API data from NASA, use functions to turn the data into usuable content, then update the dom with the new information from NASA's space photo object.

# Third Step

Create a catch splash page for when the API can't be reached.

# Fourth Step

Then I will be setting the style sheet elements to properly lay out the clean design of the web page as well as prepare the style elements that will be manipulated by Javasript to make the page interactive.

# Fifth Step

Then I will be the creation of a function that handles changing the discriptions visibility and creating a click event using the function in the render function init()

# Sixth Step

Then the next step is to create the function that adds the css zoom effect and add a hover over event that uses it in the DOM loaded function.

# Final Step

Upload the finished project to githubs web hosting and create a relevent public url that it can be reached by anyone.
